## API key safety:

SpeakGPT uses OpenAI API to provide you with the best experience. Using API-keys is more secure than using your username/password. Your personal info can't be obtained using API key. OpenAI provides cheap API access to their services. Your API key is stored locally on your device and is not shared with anyone. SpeakGPT does not collect any personal data. SpeakGPT is open-source and you can check the code yourself. Each release of SpeakGPT is checked on VirusTotal.
If you have any concerns you can secure either [revoke your API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or use a separate API key for SpeakGPT.

To secure your API key perform the following steps:

1. Make sure you have separate API key for SpeakGPT
2. Set up billing limit
3. Enable usage monitoring, so you can see how much resources SpeakGPT uses and how much it costs
4. If you have any concerns you can revoke your API key

> Why we obfuscate our code in production releases?
> 
> Obfuscation and resources shrinking allows us to optimize app size, it performance and secure it against reverse engineering or tamper and make sure your credentials like API keys in a safe place.. You can request an unobfuscated build or compile it by self to make sure our app is safe.
