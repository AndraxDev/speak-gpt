Image generation is available in chats and assistant mode, but not in playground.\n● GPT 4 Vision access (use your photos and images with GPT) - By clicking attach button in a chat or in assistant mode, you can either select an image from your gallery or open a camera. Then enter supporting prompt (optional) and click send.\n● Custom AI models (fine-tuned) are supported - Depending on AI services provider selected, you can use your fine-tuned models directly in SpeakGPT.
